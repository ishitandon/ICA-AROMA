Hello all,
I am trying to install ICA-AROMA on my macOS Catalina 10.15.3. 
I am unable to do so because of the following error-

Apples-MacBook-Air:~ apple$ curl -sSL "https://github.com/rhr-pruim/ICA-AROMA/archive/v0.4.3-beta.tar.gz" | tar -xzC /opt/ICA-AROMA --strip-componets 1
tar: Option --strip-componets is not supported
Usage:
  List:    tar -tf <archive-filename>
  Extract: tar -xf <archive-filename>
  Create:  tar -cf <archive-filename> [filenames...]
  Help:    tar --help
curl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 1370)

 I am having FSL (version 6.0) pre-installed and default python 2.7 that comes with mac. Also I tried installing python modules - os, argparse,numpy,commands, random using pip.
 But there is a following error in installing the commands and random module.
 
 Apples-MacBook-Air:bin apple$ pip install commands

I am no sure what the issue is? Can someone look into it?
Thanks in advance
